# Analize A/B Test Results New Page

This project is part of the tasks in the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree, and aims to practice the skills learned during the course.

For this project, I worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. My goal was to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

The data for this analysis was provided by Udacity.

The whole project is developed within [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) and the data is imported and worked using the [Pandas library](https://pandas.pydata.org/) of the [Python language ](https://www.python.org/).
